##
# An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95
# for the first item in an order, and $2.95 for each subsequent item in the same order.
# Write a function that takes the number of items in the order as its only parameter.
# Return the shipping charge for the order as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main
# program that reads the number of items purchased from the user and displays the
# shipping charge.
